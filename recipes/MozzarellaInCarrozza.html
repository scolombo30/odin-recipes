    <h1>Mozzarella In Carrozza</h1>
    <img src="../images/mozzarella.jpg" alt="Mozzarella In Carrozza" width="65%"> 
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Fried mozzarella was created as a recipe for recycling everything 
        left over from the previous lunch and turning it into something really appetizing! 
        These fritters with a fragrant shell and a filled core will please everyone thanks 
        to their simplicity, but if you want to make a gourmet version, try adding anchovies,
        dried tomatoes, basil and black pepper inside. An explosion of flavors that you can 
        enhance by breading with panko, special Japanese breadcrumbs instead of classic 
        breadcrumbs, the resulting crunchiness will conquer everyone bite after bite!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>600g White bread loaf</li>
        <li>500g Mozzarella di bufala cheese</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>5 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>100g Flour 00</li>
        <li>300g Breadcrumbs</li>
        <h5>TO FRY</h5>
        <li>1L Sunflower seed oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by cutting the buffalo mozzarella into 1/2" (1 cm) thick slices.</li>
        <li>Place them gradually on a tray lined with blotting paper.</li>
        <li>Cover with more blotting paper.</li>
        <li>Press gently with your hands to blot the mozzarella and remove excess water.</li>
        <li>If necessary, use paper towels until it is completely dry.</li>
        <li>Put the slices of bread on a cutting board.</li>
        <li>Place the slices of mozzarella on top, so as to cover the entire surface, but without letting it stick out.</li>
        <li>Add salt.</li>
        <li>Cover each slice with another slice of bread.</li>
        <li>press gently with your hands to pack it all together. Continue like this for all the other slices of bread.</li>
        <li>Trim the slices of stuffed bread using a knife, to remove the outer crust.</li>
        <li>You can cut the mozzarella in the bread in two different ways. By cutting a cross you will get 4 squares from each slice.</li>
        <li>For a triangular cut you have to cut the bread first in half on the diagonal and then in half on the other diagonal. This way you will get 4 triangles.</li>
        <li>Continue this way until all the pieces are finished.</li>
        <li>Now switch to the breading. Break the eggs into an oven dish and beat them with a whisk for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>In two other baking dishes place the breadcrumbs in one and the sifted flour in the other. At this point dip each piece of stuffed bread first into the flour.</li>
        <li>Using 2 forks into the egg 17, to coat them completely.</li>
        <li>Set them on a plate for a few seconds, to remove the excess egg part and avoid lumps when you dip it in the breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a cutting board and with the blade of a knife lightly press the edges and the surface in order to even out the breadcrumbs and make a more precise shape.</li>
        <li>If necessary, dip it in the breadcrumbs again and press again with the knife blade.</li>
        <li>Continue in this way for all the other pieces and transfer them gradually to a tray lined with baking paper.</li>
        <li>Place in the fridge for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>You can start with the second breading, first dip into the egg.</li>
        <li>Then set in the saucer to remove the excess.</li>
        <li>Finally dip in the breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pieces of breaded mozzarella onto a cutting board and with the blade of a knife even out the breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Continue this way for all the others by placing them on a tray lined with baking paper.</li>
        <li>Pour the oil into a frying pan and bring it to a temperature of 340-350° F (170-180° C) maximum.</li>
        <li>Put in a few pieces at a time and cook the fried mozzarellas for 1-2 minutes, turning them from time to time with a skimmer.</li>
        <li>When they are well browned, drain them from the oil and put them on a tray lined with absorbent paper to remove the excess oil. Fry the others and serve. </li>
