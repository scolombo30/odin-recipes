    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Fried mozzarella was created as a recipe for recycling everything 
        left over from the previous lunch and turning it into something really appetizing! 
        These fritters with a fragrant shell and a filled core will please everyone thanks 
        to their simplicity, but if you want to make a gourmet version, try adding anchovies,
        dried tomatoes, basil and black pepper inside. An explosion of flavors that you can 
        enhance by breading with panko, special Japanese breadcrumbs instead of classic 
        breadcrumbs, the resulting crunchiness will conquer everyone bite after bite!
