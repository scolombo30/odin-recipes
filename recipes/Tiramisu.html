    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="descrizione">
        Back in the day, grandmothers used to prepare a breakfast that we might call humble
        today, but was considered very rich at the time! Today the recipe is still unchanged, 
        just break a very fresh egg into a glass, beat it with sugar, and add coffee or hot milk,
        for children, or Marsala wine or aniseed for adults. This marvelous cream gave rise to 
        mascarpone cream used to make Tiramisù (mascarpone cheese and ladyfingers dessert). 
        This is the best Italian dessert, the most popular and beloved of them all, and it has 
        also birthed many other versions, even an egg-free Tiramisù! There is also a strawberry 
        and Nutella tiramisù! Although the origins of this famous dessert are unclear, because 
        it is disputed between the regions of Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Piedmont, and 
        Tuscany, it remains a cornerstone of Italian cuisine and it's widely prepared from North 
        to South.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredienti">
        <li>300g Ladyfingers</li>
        <li>4 Medium sized eggs</li>
        <li>500g Mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>100g Sugar</li>
        <li>300g Coffee</li>
        <li>Cocoa powder to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="passi">
        <li>Carefully separate the egg whites from the yolks, remembering that to whip the egg whites well they must not contain any trace of yolk.</li>
        <li>Whip the egg yolks with a hand mixer, pouring in only half of the sugar.</li>
        <li>As soon as the mixture has become clear and frothy, you can add mascarpone cheese, little by little.</li>
        <li>When all the cheese is incorporated, you will have obtained a thick and compact cream; set it aside.</li>
        <li>Clean the mixer attachments very well and beat the egg whites, pouring in the remaining sugar a little at a time.</li>
        <li>Whisk them into stiff peaks. Take a spoonful of egg whites and pour it into the bowl with egg yolks and sugar and stir vigorously with a spatula, to thin the mixture.</li>
        <li>Then proceed to add the remaining egg whites, little by little, stirring very gently from bottom to top.</li>
        <li>Once ready, place a generous spoonful of cream on the bottom of a 12x8in baking pan and spread it evenly.</li>
        <li>Then soak the ladyfingers for a few moments in the cooled coffee, which you will have sweetened to your liking. First on one side and then the other.</li>
        <li>Arrange the soaked ladyfingers on top of the cream, side by side, to create the first layer, over which you will spread part of the mascarpone cheese cream </li>
        <li>Make sure to level it carefully so that you have a smooth surface.</li>
        <li>Continue to arrange the coffee-soaked ladyfingers.</li>
        <li>Then add another layer of cream.</li>
        <li>Level the surface, sprinkle it with unsweetened cocoa powder, and allow it to set in the fridge for a couple of hours.</li>
        <li>Your Tiramisù is ready to be enjoyed!</li>
