    <p class="descrizione">
        In this dish are all the scents of the Mediterranean that dress the spaghetti,
        partly cooked with the sauce to absorb the tas11te of the sea and become even
        more appetizing! There are countless versions of this delicacy. Here's mine,
        with clams, mussels and delicious scampi flesh! But feel free to add or replace 
        the ingredients with razor clams, cuttlefish and baby octopus and enjoy seafood 
        linguine that is always different and even more delicious!

    <ul class="ingredienti">
        <li>320g Spaghetti</li>
        <li>1kg Mussels</li>
        <li>1kg Clams</li>
        <li>300g Squid</li>
        <li>8 Scampi</li>
        <li>300g Cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 tbsp Extra vergin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 Garlic clove</li>
        <li>1 Parsley sprig</li>
        <li>3 tbsp White wine</li>
        <li>Fine salt to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="passi">
        <li>Start by cleaning the mussels and clams, then place a colander over a container so that it does not touch the bottom and fill it with cold running water, leaving the clams to purge any sand. Pour out the water and repeat, then leave them to soak.</li>
        <li>Next, clean the mussels: remove any dirt on the shells with the back of a knife, if needed, and tear off the byssus, i.e. the "beard" that comes out of the shell.</li>
        <li>Scrub clean with a new stainless steel pad.</li>
        <li>If you notice a black spot on the chopping board it means that it's full of sand and should therefore be discarded.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saucepan and when it is hot, pour in the clams and mussels.</li>
        <li>Cover immediately with a lid and wait until they are all completely open, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the mussels and clams are open, remove the lid.</li>
        <li>Pour them into a container.</li>
        <li>Do not discard the cooking liquid but strain it through a tight mesh strainer and keep it warm.</li>
        <li>Shell both clams and mussels 10 and set aside the flesh and some shells still full.</li>
        <li>Unless it's already cleaned, your calamari (squid) will need to be cleaned: remove the head, entrails and the outer skin.</li>
        <li>Cut it open, then cut it into strips.</li>
        <li>Then clean the scampi by cutting the sides of the tail with scissors and removing the shell that covers the abdomen.</li>
        <li>Using a toothpick, try to remove the gut, the black vein on the back of the scampi. This way it won't release a bitter taste. Now wash the tomatoes and cut them into wedges.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, place a pot full of salted water on the stove and bring it to a boil, it will be used to cook the spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a pan with 2 tablespoons (25 g) of extra virgin olive oil and add a clove of garlic.</li>
        <li>Once it is golden brown, pour in the squid and add a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Cook for 5 minutes then sweat with the white wine.</li>
        <li>Let the wine evaporate, remove the garlic.</li>
        <li>Add the cherry tomatoes and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in boiling water.</li>
        <li>Add the scampi to the sauce, season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Drain the spaghetti directly into the pan 4 minutes before their cooking time is up.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking and pour the mussels and clams cooking water you had set aside.</li>
        <li>Lastly, add the shelled mussels and clams</li>
        <li>At the end of cooking, turn off the heat, season with a chopped sprig of parsley and toss one last time. Serve seafood spaghetti very hot.</li>
