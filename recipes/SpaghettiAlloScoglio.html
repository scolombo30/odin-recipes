    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        In this dish are all the scents of the Mediterranean that dress the spaghetti,
        partly cooked with the sauce to absorb the tas11te of the sea and become even
        more appetizing! There are countless versions of this delicacy. Here's mine,
        with clams, mussels and delicious scampi flesh! But feel free to add or replace 
        the ingredients with razor clams, cuttlefish and baby octopus and enjoy seafood 
        linguine that is always different and even more delicious!
